The PUT method is used to update existing data on the server.

In React, PUT requests are commonly made using fetch API or Axios.

It sends updated data to a specific API endpoint using an ID or resource URL.

PUT requests usually include headers like Content-Type: application/json.

State is updated using useState after a successful response.

The useEffect hook may be used to load initial data before updating.

Error handling is implemented using try–catch or .catch().

PUT helps maintain data consistency between UI and backend.

Commonly used in edit forms and profile update features.
